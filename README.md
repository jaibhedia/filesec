# Scan Byte: Detecting Known Threats through Signature Analysis

## Project Overview
Scan Byte is a Java-based desktop application designed to detect malicious files through signature analysis. The application provides a user-friendly interface for scanning files and directories, generating detailed threat reports, and managing threat signatures.

## Key Features
- **Signature-based Threat Detection**: Utilizes a database of known threat signatures to identify malicious files.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with JavaFX, the application offers an intuitive interface for users to interact with.
- **Threat Reporting**: Generates detailed reports of detected threats, including file paths and signature details.
- **Signature Management**: Allows users to add, remove, and update threat signatures in the database.
- **External Threat Database Integration**: Optionally integrates with external databases like VirusTotal for enhanced threat detection.

## Technology Stack
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **JavaFX/Swing**: Frameworks for building the graphical user interface.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing threat signatures.
- **Apache Commons Codec**: Library for encoding and decoding operations, particularly for hash generation.

## Expected Outcome
- A fully functional signature-based threat detection engine.
- An interactive GUI for scanning files and directories.
- Detailed threat reports generated after scans.
- A signature management module for easy updates and maintenance.
- Optional integration with external threat databases for improved detection capabilities.
- A secure, customizable, and lightweight tool for detecting known malware.
